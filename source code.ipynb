Y. EVANS-WENTZ, M.A., D.Litt., D.Sc. \\nJesus College, Oxford; Author of \\nThe Tibetan Book of the Dead, \\nTibet's Great Yogi Milarepa, Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, etc. \\nThe value of Yogananda's Autobiography is greatly enhanced by the fact that it is one of the few books in English about the wise men of India which has been written, not by a journalist or foreigner, but by one of \\ntheir own race and training--in short, a book about yogis by a yogi. As an eyewitness recountal of the \\nextraordinary lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the book has importance both timely and timeless. To its illustrious author, whom I have had the pleasure of knowing both in India and America, may every reader render due appreciation and gratitude. His unusual life-document is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be \\npublished in the West. \\nIt has been my privilege to have met one of the sages whose life- history is herein narrated-Sri Yukteswar \\nGiri. A likeness of the venerable saint appeared as part of the frontispiece of my Tibetan Yoga and Secret \\nDoctrines. 1-1 It was at Puri, in Orissa, on the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then \\nthe head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly occupied in the spiritual training of a \\ngroup of youthful disciples. He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the people of the United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa Yogananda, whom he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to the West. \\nSri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration which his\"), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage6'}, page_content='followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or \\nnot, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had chosen as his place of earthly abode the holy city of Puri, whither multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath, \"Lord of the World.\" It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed \\nhis mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of being and passed on, knowing that his \\nincarnation had been carried to a triumphant completion. I am glad, indeed, to be able to record this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar. Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly and in tranquillity to that ideal life which Paramhansa Yogananda, his disciple, has now described for the ages. W. Y. EVANS-WENTZ \\n1-1: Oxford University Press, 1935. \\nAuthor\\'s Acknowledgments\\nI am deeply indebted to Miss L. V. Pratt for her long editorial labors over the manuscript of this book. My thanks are due also to Miss Ruth Zahn for preparation of the index, to Mr. C. Richard Wright for permission to use extracts from his Indian travel diary, and to Dr. W. Y.

Emerging in every generation, they have bulwarked their land against the fate \\nof Babylon and Egypt. \\nI find my earliest memories covering the anachronistic features of a previous incarnation. Clear \\nrecollections came to me of a distant life, a yogi 1-3 amidst the Himalayan snows.

I was resentfully conscious \\nof not being able to walk or express myself freely. Prayerful surges arose within me as I realized my bodily impotence. My strong emotional life took silent form as words in many languages. Among the inward confusion of tongues, my ear gradually accustomed itself to the circumambient Bengali syllables of my people. The beguiling scope of an infant\\'s mind! adultly considered limited to toys and toes. \\nPsychological ferment and my unresponsive body brought me to many obstinate crying-spells. I recall the general family bewilderment at my distress. Happier memories, too, crowd in on me: my mother\\'s caresses, and my first attempts at lisping phrase and toddling step. These early triumphs, usually forgotten quickly, are yet a natural basis of self-confidence. \\nMy far-reaching memories are not unique. Many yogis are known to have retained their self-consciousness without interruption by the dramatic transition to and from \"life\" and \"death.\" If man be solely a body, its loss indeed places the final period to identity. But if prophets down the millenniums spake with truth, man is essentially of incorporeal nature. The persistent core of human egoity is only temporarily allied with sense perception. \\nAlthough odd, clear memories of infancy are not extremely rare.

But Mother was a queen of hearts, and taught us only through love. After her death, Father displayed more of his inner tenderness. I noticed then that his gaze often metamorphosed into my mother\\'s. \\nIn Mother\\'s presence we tasted our earliest bitter-sweet acquaintance with the scriptures.

Instruction and chastisement went hand in hand. \\nA daily gesture of respect to Father was given by Mother\\'s dressing us carefully in the afternoons \\nto welcome him home from the office. His position was similar to that of a vice-president, in the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, one of India\\'s large companies. His work involved traveling, and our family lived in several cities during my childhood. \\nMother held an open hand toward the needy. Father was also kindly disposed, but his respect for law and order extended to the budget. One fortnight Mother spent, in feeding the poor, more than Father\\'s monthly income. \\n\"All I ask, please, is to keep your charities within a reasonable limit.\" Even a gentle rebuke from her husband was grievous to Mother. She ordered a hackney carriage, not hinting to the children at any disagreement. \\n\"Good-by; I am going away to my mother\\'s home.\" Ancient ultimatum! \\nWe broke into astounded lamentations. Our maternal uncle arrived opportunely; he whispered to Father some sage counsel, garnered no doubt from the ages. After Father had made a few conciliatory remarks, Mother happily dismissed the cab. Thus ended the only trouble I ever noticed between my parents. But I recall a characteristic discussion. \\n\"Please give me ten rupees for a hapless woman who has just arrived at the house.\" Mother\\'s smile had its own persuasion. \\n\"Why ten rupees? One is enough.\" Father added a justification: \"When my father and grandparents died suddenly, I had my first taste of poverty.

His sons bought automobiles after they \\ncame into popular use, but Father was always content with the trolley car for his daily ride to the office. The accumulation of money for the sake of power was alien to his nature. Once, after organizing the Calcutta Urban Bank, he refused to benefit himself by holding any of its shares. He had simply wished to perform a civic duty in his spare time. \\nSeveral years after Father had retired on a pension, an English accountant arrived to examine the books of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway Company. The amazed investigator discovered that Father had never applied for overdue bonuses. \\n\"He did the work of three men!\" the accountant told the company. \"He has rupees 125,000 (about $41,250.) owing to him as back compensation.\" The officials presented Father with a check for this amount. He thought so little about it that he overlooked any mention to the family. Much later he was questioned by my youngest brother Bishnu, who noticed the large deposit on a bank statement. \\n\"Why be elated by material profit?\" Father replied. \"The one who pursues a goal of evenmindedness is neither jubilant with gain nor depressed by loss.

Everything was in readiness-the banquet delicacies, the gay throne on which Brother was to be carried to the home of the bride-to-be, the rows of colorful lights, the mammoth cardboard elephants and camels, the English, Scottish and Indian \\norchestras, the professional entertainers, the priests for the ancient rituals. \\nFather and I, in gala spirits, were planning to join the family in time for the ceremony. Shortly \\nbefore the great day, however, I had an ominous vision. \\nIt was in Bareilly on a midnight. As I slept beside Father on the piazza of our bungalow, I was awakened by a peculiar flutter of the mosquito netting over the bed.

I sobbed out the fatal tidings. \\n\"Never mind that hallucination of yours.\" Father gave his characteristic negation to a new situation. \"Your mother is in excellent health. If we get any bad news, we shall leave tomorrow.\" \\n\"You shall never forgive yourself for not starting now!\" Anguish caused me to add bitterly, \"Nor shall I ever forgive you!\" \\nThe melancholy morning came with explicit words: \"Mother dangerously ill; marriage postponed; come at once.\"'), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage16'}, page_content='before the great day, however, I had an ominous vision. \\nIt was in Bareilly on a midnight.

One of my uncles met us en route at a transfer point. A train thundered toward us, looming with telescopic increase. From my inner tumult, an abrupt determination arose to hurl myself on the railroad tracks. Already bereft, I felt, of my mother, I could not endure a world suddenly barren to the bone.

Her words brought final healing to my suppurating wounds: \\n\"It is I who have watched over thee, life after life, in the tenderness of many mothers! See in My gaze the two black eyes, the lost beautiful eyes, thou seekest!\" \\nFather and I returned to Bareilly soon after the crematory rites for the well-beloved. Early every \\nmorning I made a pathetic memorial- pilgrimage to a large sheoli tree which shaded the smooth, green-gold lawn before our bungalow. In poetical moments, I thought that the white sheoli \\nflowers were strewing themselves with a willing devotion over the grassy altar. Mingling tears with the dew, I often observed a strange other-worldly light emerging from the dawn. Intense pangs of longing for God assailed me. I felt powerfully drawn to the Himalayas. \\nOne of my cousins, fresh from a period of travel in the holy hills, visited us in Bareilly.

My heart wept for the lost Mothers, human and divine. \\nThe rent left in the family fabric by Mother\\'s death was irreparable. Father never remarried \\nduring his nearly forty remaining years. Assuming the difficult role of Father-Mother to his little flock, he grew noticeably more tender, more approachable. With calmness and insight, he solved the various family problems.

But in any case you are bristling with divine ardor. When I captured you recently on your way to the Himalayas, I came to a definite resolve. I must not further postpone the fulfillment of my solemn promise.\" My brother handed me a small box, and delivered Mother\\'s message. \\n\"Let these words be my final blessing, my beloved son Mukunda!\" Mother had said. \"The hour is here when I must relate a number of phenomenal events following your birth.

The percentage is high of happy Indian marriages. \\n2-3: An anchorite; one who pursues a sadhana or path of spiritual discipline. \\n2-4: When I discovered by these words that Mother had possessed secret knowledge of a short life, I understood for the first time why she had been insistent on hastening the plans for Ananta\\'s marriage.

He permitted me, even as a mere boy, to visit many cities and pilgrimage spots. Usually one or more of my friends accompanied me; we would travel comfortably on first-class passes provided by Father.

Reaching Benares, I proceeded immediately to the swami\\'s residence. The front door was open; I made my way to a long, hall-like room on the second floor. A rather stout man, wearing only a loincloth, was seated in lotus posture on a slightly raised platform. His head and unwrinkled face were clean-shaven; a beatific smile played about his lips.

Stop in the lane \\nwhere no one in my house can see you.\" \\nThese were my final instructions to Amar Mitter, a high school friend who planned to accompany me to the Himalayas. We had chosen the following day for our flight. Precautions were necessary, as Ananta exercised a vigilant eye. He was determined to foil the plans of escape which he suspected were uppermost in my mind. The amulet, like a spiritual yeast, was silently at work within me. Amidst the Himalayan snows, I hoped to find the master whose face often appeared to me in visions. \\nThe family was living now in Calcutta, where Father had been permanently transferred. Following the patriarchal Indian custom, Ananta had brought his bride to live in our home, now at 4 Gurpar Road. There in a small attic room I engaged in daily meditations and prepared my mind for the divine search. \\nThe memorable morning arrived with inauspicious rain. Hearing the wheels of Amar\\'s carriage in the road, I hastily tied together a blanket, a pair of sandals, Lahiri Mahasaya\\'s picture, a copy of \\nthe Bhagavad Gita, a string of prayer beads, and two loincloths. This bundle I threw from my \\nthird-story window. I ran down the steps and passed my uncle, buying fish at the door. \\n\"What is the excitement?\" His gaze roved suspiciously over my person. \\nI gave him a noncommittal smile and walked to the lane. Retrieving my bundle, I joined Amar with conspiratorial caution. We drove to Chadni Chowk, a merchandise center. For months we had been saving our tiffin money to buy English clothes. Knowing that my clever brother could easily play the part of a detective, we thought to outwit him by European garb. \\nOn the way to the station, we stopped for my cousin, Jotin Ghosh, whom I called Jatinda. He was a new convert, longing for a guru in the Himalayas. He donned the new suit we had in readiness. Well- camouflaged, we hoped!

As soon as the train, like ourselves, was in flight, I gave utterance to a few of my glorious anticipations. \\n\"Just imagine!\" I ejaculated. \"We shall be initiated by the masters and experience the trance of cosmic consciousness. Our flesh will be charged with such magnetism that wild animals of the Himalayas will come tamely near us. Tigers will be no more than meek house cats awaiting our caresses!\" \\nThis remark-picturing a prospect I considered entrancing, both metaphorically and literally-brought an enthusiastic smile from Amar. But Jatinda averted his gaze, directing it through the window at the scampering landscape. \\n\"Let the money be divided in three portions.\" Jatinda broke a long silence with this suggestion. \"Each of us should buy his own ticket at Burdwan. Thus no one at the station will surmise that we are running away together.\" \\nI unsuspectingly agreed. At dusk our train stopped at Burdwan.

Not anger but \"divinest melancholy\" was responsible, I knew, for my unconventional behavior. \\nThe official then turned to Amar. The duel of wits that followed hardly permitted me to maintain the counseled stoic gravity. \\n\"Where is the third boy?\" The man injected a full ring of authority into his voice. \"Come on; speak the truth!\" \\n\"Sir, I notice you are wearing eyeglasses.

A premonition of capture weighed on my mind. \\nDeeming it advisable to leave Hardwar at once, we bought tickets to proceed north to Rishikesh, a soil long hallowed by feet of many masters. I had already boarded the train, while Amar lagged on the platform. He was brought to an abrupt halt by a shout from a policeman.

Jules-Bois explained that the awakening of the higher consciousness \"was not to be confused with Coueism or hypnotism. The existence of a superconscious mind has long been recognized philosophically, being in reality the Oversoul spoken of by Emerson, but only recently has it been recognized scientifically.\" The French scientist pointed out that from the superconsciousness come inspiration, genius, moral values. \"Belief in this is not mysticism though it'), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage55'}, page_content='recognized and valued the qualities which mystics preached.\" \\n7-4: St. Theresa of Avila and other Christian saints were often observed in a state of levitation. \\n7-5: \"Great sage.\" \\n7-6: Actual perception of God. \\n7-7: The saint\\'s full name was Nagendranath Bhaduri.

I cannot deny my keen interest in evidence that India can play a leading part in physics, and not metaphysics alone. \\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" \\nThe professor obligingly explained. \"Bose was the first one to invent a wireless coherer and an instrument for indicating the refraction of electric waves.

Furthermore, they found that nitella fibers, on being excited, propagate electrical waves that are similar in every way, except velocity, to those of the nerve fibers in animals and man. The electrical nerve impulses in the plant were found to be much slower than those in animals.

I entered for the first time the hermitage \\nwhere I was to spend the best part of the next ten years with India\\'s Jyanavatar, \"incarnation of \\nwisdom.\" \\n11-1: See chapter 25 . \\n11-2: The world-famous mausoleum.. \\n11-3: A dhoti-cloth is knotted around the waist and covers the legs.. \\n11-4: Brindaban, in the Muttra district of United Provinces, is the Hindu Jerusalem.

First Father, now Sri Yukteswar! \\n\"Someday you will go to the West. Its people will lend ears more receptive to India\\'s ancient wisdom if the strange Hindu teacher has a university degree.\" \\n\"You know best, Guruji.\" My gloom departed. The reference to the West I found puzzling, remote; but my opportunity to please Master by obedience was vitally immediate. \\n\"You will be near in Calcutta; come here whenever you find time.\" \\n\"Every day if possible, Master! Gratefully I accept your authority in every detail of my life-on one condition.\" \\n\"Yes?\" \\n\"That you promise to reveal God to me!\" \\nAn hour-long verbal tussle ensued. A master\\'s word cannot be falsified; it is not lightly given. The implications in the pledge open out vast metaphysical vistas. A guru must be on intimate terms indeed with the Creator before he can obligate Him to appear! I sensed Sri Yukteswar\\'s divine unity, and was determined, as his disciple, to press my advantage. \\n\"You are of exacting disposition!\" Then Master\\'s consent rang out with compassionate finality: \\n\"Let your wish be my wish.\" \\nLifelong shadow lifted from my heart; the vague search, hither and yon, was over. I had found eternal shelter in a true guru. \\n\"Come; I will show you the hermitage.\" Master rose from his tiger mat. I glanced about me; my gaze fell with astonishment on a wall picture, garlanded with a spray of jasmine. \\n\"Lahiri Mahasaya!\"'), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage87'}, page_content='\"Yes, my divine guru.\" Sri Yukteswar\\'s tone was reverently vibrant. \"Greater he was, as man and \\nyogi, than any other teacher whose life came within the range of my investigations.\" \\nSilently I bowed before the familiar picture. Soul-homage sped to the peerless master who, blessing my infancy, had guided my steps to this hour. \\nLed by my guru, I strolled over the house and its grounds. Large, ancient and well-built, the hermitage was surrounded by a massive- pillared courtyard. Outer walls were moss-covered; pigeons fluttered over the flat gray roof, unceremoniously sharing the ashram quarters. A rear garden was pleasant with jackfruit, mango, and plantain trees. Balustraded balconies of upper rooms in the two-storied building faced the courtyard from three sides. A spacious ground-floor hall, with high ceiling supported by colonnades, was used, Master said, chiefly during the annual \\nfestivities of Durgapuja. \\n12-1 A narrow stairway led to Sri Yukteswar\\'s sitting room, whose small \\nbalcony overlooked the street.

Sleep was sound and sweet the first night under my guru\\'s roof. \\nSri Yukteswar chose the following morning to grant me his Kriya Yoga initiation. The technique I had already received from two disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya-Father and my tutor, Swami Kebalananda-but in Master\\'s presence I felt transforming power. At his touch, a great light broke upon my being, like glory of countless suns blazing together. A flood of ineffable bliss, overwhelming my heart to an innermost core, continued during the following day. It was late that afternoon before I could bring myself to leave the hermitage. \\n\"You will return in thirty days.\" As I reached my Calcutta home, the fulfillment of Master\\'s prediction entered with me.

My readers have doubtless made the perspicacious surmise that I was little seen in the college classrooms. The Serampore hermitage held a lure too irresistible. Master accepted my ubiquitous presence without comment. To my relief, he seldom referred to the halls of learning. Though it was plain to all that I was never cut out for a scholar, I managed to attain minimum passing grades from time to time. \\nDaily life at the ashram flowed smoothly, infrequently varied.

Its preparation, according to Master's daily directions, had been the careful task of young disciples. My guru was a vegetarian. Before embracing monkhood, however, he had eaten eggs and fish. His advice to students was to follow any simple diet which proved suited to one's constitution. \\nMaster ate little; often rice, colored with turmeric or juice of beets or spinach and lightly \\nsprinkled with buffalo ghee or melted butter.

To a man who has realized himself as a soul, not the body or the ego, the rest of humanity assumes a striking similarity of aspect. \\nThe impartiality of saints is rooted in wisdom. Masters have escaped maya; its alternating faces of intellect and idiocy no longer cast an influential glance. Sri Yukteswar showed no special consideration to those who happened to be powerful or accomplished; neither did he slight others for their poverty or illiteracy. He would listen respectfully to words of truth from a child, and openly ignore a conceited pundit. \\nMY MASTER, SRI YUKTESWAR \\nDisciple of Lahiri Mahasaya \\nEight o'clock was the supper hour, and sometimes found lingering guests.

Yet he was economical; his modest funds went far. \"Be comfortable within your purse,\" he often said. \"Extravagance will buy you discomfort.\" Whether in the details of hermitage entertainment, or his building and repair work, or other practical concerns, Master manifested the originality of a creative spirit. \\nQuiet evening hours often brought one of my guru\\'s discourses, treasures against time. His every utterance was measured and chiseled by wisdom. A sublime self-assurance marked his mode of expression: it was unique. He spoke as none other in my experience ever spoke. His thoughts were weighed in a delicate balance of discrimination before he permitted them an outward garb. The essence of truth, all-pervasive with even a physiological aspect, came from him like a fragrant exudation of the soul. I was conscious always that I was in the presence of a living manifestation \\nof God. The weight of his divinity automatically bowed my head before him. \\nIf late guests detected that Sri Yukteswar was becoming engrossed with the Infinite, he quickly \\nengaged them in conversation. He was incapable of striking a pose, or of flaunting his inner withdrawal. Always one with the Lord, he needed no separate time for communion.

I was dismayed to discover that in the Serampore hermitage this prudent custom was honored in the breach. Yet the insects were in full residency; I was bitten from head to foot. My guru took pity on me. \\n\"Buy yourself a curtain, and also one for me.\" He laughed and added, \"If you buy only one, for yourself, all mosquitoes will concentrate on me!\" \\nI was more than thankful to comply. Every night that I spent in Serampore, my guru would ask me to arrange the bedtime curtains. \\nThe mosquitoes one evening were especially virulent. But Master failed to issue his usual instructions. I listened nervously to the anticipatory hum of the insects. Getting into bed, I threw a propitiatory prayer in their general direction. A half hour later, I coughed pretentiously to attract my guru\\'s attention. I thought I would go mad with the bites and especially the singing drone as the mosquitoes celebrated bloodthirsty rites.'), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage91'}, page_content='No responsive stir from Master; I approached him cautiously. He was not breathing. This was my \\nfirst observation of him in the yogic trance; it filled me with fright. \\n\"His heart must have failed!\" I placed a mirror under his nose; no breath-vapor appeared. To make doubly certain, for minutes I closed his mouth and nostrils with my fingers. His body was cold and motionless. In a daze, I turned toward the door to summon help. \\n\"So! A budding experimentalist! My poor nose!\" Master\\'s voice was shaky with laughter. \"Why don\\'t you go to bed? Is the whole world going to change for you? Change yourself: be rid of the mosquito consciousness.\" \\nMeekly I returned to my bed. Not one insect ventured near. I realized that my guru had previously agreed to the curtains only to please me; he had no fear of mosquitoes. His yogic power was such that he either could will them not to bite, or could escape to an inner invulnerability. \\n\"He was giving me a demonstration,\" I thought. \"That is the yogic state I must strive to attain.\" A yogi must be able to pass into, and continue in, the superconsciousness, regardless of multitudinous distractions never absent from this earth.

But a deadly cobra once confronted him, only to be conquered by my guru\\'s love. This variety of snake is much feared in India, where it causes more than five thousand deaths annually. The dangerous encounter took place at Puri, where Sri Yukteswar had a second hermitage, charmingly situated near the Bay of Bengal. Prafulla, a young disciple of later years, was with Master on this occasion. \\n\"We were seated outdoors near the ashram,\" Prafulla told me. \"A cobra appeared near-by, a four-foot length of sheer terror.

The hard core of human egotism is hardly to be dislodged except rudely. With its departure, the Divine finds at last an unobstructed channel. In vain It seeks to percolate through flinty hearts of selfishness. \\nSri Yukteswar\\'s wisdom was so penetrating that, heedless of remarks, he often replied to one\\'s unspoken observation. \"What a person imagines he hears, and what the speaker has really implied, may be poles apart,\" he said. \"Try to feel the thoughts behind the confusion of men\\'s verbiage.\" \\nBut divine insight is painful to worldly ears; Master was not popular with superficial students.

He cannot perform the ceremonial family rites which are obligatory on the householder. Yet Shankara, the ancient founder of the Swami Order, disregarded the injunctions. At the death of his beloved mother, he cremated her body with heavenly fire which he caused to spurt from his upraised hand. \\nSri Yukteswar also ignored the restrictions, in a fashion less spectacular. When his mother passed on, he arranged the crematory services by the holy Ganges in Benares, and fed many Brahmins in conformance with age-old custom. \\nThe shastric prohibitions were intended to help swamis overcome narrow identifications. Shankara and Sri Yukteswar had wholly merged their beings in the Impersonal Spirit; they needed no rescue by rule.

Yet their reluctant departure would bring an expressed conviction that Sri Yukteswar had shown precise insight into their specialized fields of knowledge. \\nMy guru always had young resident disciples in his hermitage. He directed their minds and lives with that careful discipline in which the word \"disciple\" is etymologically rooted.\\n\"I think so, sir.\" \\nSri Yukteswar was silent for a few minutes, a half-suppressed smile on his lips. \"No, you forgot,\" he said finally. \"Divine contemplation must not be made an excuse for material carelessness.

The dullest intelligence enlarged before indisputable proof of one aspect of man\\'s omnipresence. \\nThe \"plot\" of the cauliflower comedy can be best understood by a radio analogy. Sri Yukteswar was a perfect human radio. Thoughts are no more than very gentle vibrations moving in the ether.

Nearly everyone has had the experience of an inexplicably correct \"hunch,\" or has \\ntransferred his thoughts effectively to another person. \\nThe human mind, free from the static of restlessness, can perform through its antenna of intuition all the functions of complicated radio mechanisms-sending and receiving thoughts, and tuning out undesirable ones. As the power of a radio depends on the amount of electrical current it can utilize, so the human radio is energized according to the power of will possessed by each individual. \\nAll thoughts vibrate eternally in the cosmos. By deep concentration, a master is able to detect the thoughts of any mind, living or dead. Thoughts are universally and not individually rooted; a truth cannot be created, but only perceived. The erroneous thoughts of man result from imperfections in his discernment. The goal of yoga science is to calm the mind, that without distortion it may mirror the divine vision in the universe. \\nRadio and television have brought the instantaneous sound and sight of remote persons to the firesides of millions: the first faint scientific intimations that man is an all-pervading spirit.

I addressed him with greed in my heart. \\n\"\\'I am Afzal Khan, the great fakir . What have you there?\\' \\n\"\\'This ball of gold is my sole material wealth; it can be of no interest to a fakir . I implore you, sir, to heal my limp.\\' \\n\"I touched the ball and walked away without reply. The old man hobbled after me.

Yet a torturing surmise sometimes haunts me: may not untapped soul possibilities exist? Is man not missing his real destiny if he fails to explore them?\" \\nThese remarks of Dijen Babu, my roommate at the Panthi boardinghouse, were called forth by my invitation that he meet my guru. \\n\"Sri Yukteswarji will initiate you into Kriya Yoga,\" I replied. \"It calms the dualistic turmoil by a divine inner certainty.\" \\nThat evening Dijen accompanied me to the hermitage. In Master\\'s presence my friend received such spiritual peace that he was soon a constant visitor. The trivial preoccupations of daily life are not enough for man; wisdom too is a native hunger. In Sri Yukteswar\\'s words Dijen found an incentive to those attempts-first painful, then effortlessly liberating-to locate a realer self within his bosom than the humiliating ego of a temporary birth, seldom ample enough for the Spirit. \\nAs Dijen and I were both pursuing the A.B. course at Serampore College, we got into the habit of walking together to the ashram as soon as classes were over. We would often see Sri Yukteswar standing on his second-floor balcony, welcoming our approach with a smile. \\nOne afternoon Kanai, a young hermitage resident, met Dijen and me at the door with disappointing news. \\n\"Master is not here; he was summoned to Calcutta by an urgent note.\" \\nThe following day I received a post card from my guru. \"I shall leave Calcutta Wednesday morning,\" he had written. \"You and Dijen meet the nine o\\'clock train at Serampore station.\"'), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage148'}, page_content='About eight-thirty on Wednesday morning, a telepathic message from Sri Yukteswar flashed \\ninsistently to my mind: \"I am delayed; don\\'t meet the nine o\\'clock train.\" \\nI conveyed the latest instructions to Dijen, who was already dressed for departure. \\n\"You and your intuition!\" My friend\\'s voice was edged in scorn. \"I prefer to trust Master\\'s written word.\" \\nI shrugged my shoulders and seated myself with quiet finality. Muttering angrily, Dijen made for the door and closed it noisily behind him. \\nAs the room was rather dark, I moved nearer to the window overlooking the street. The scant sunlight suddenly increased to an intense brilliancy in which the iron-barred window completely vanished. Against this dazzling background appeared the clearly materialized figure of Sri Yukteswar! \\nBewildered to the point of shock, I rose from my chair and knelt before him. With my customary gesture of respectful greeting at my guru\\'s feet, I touched his shoes. These were a pair familiar to me, of orange-dyed canvas, soled with rope. His ocher swami cloth brushed against me; I distinctly felt not only the texture of his robe, but also the gritty surface of the shoes, and the pressure of his toes within them. Too much astounded to utter a word, I stood up and gazed at him questioningly. \\n\"I was pleased that you got my telepathic message.\" Master\\'s voice was calm, entirely normal. \"I have now finished my business in Calcutta, and shall arrive in Serampore by the ten o\\'clock train.\" \\nAs I still stared mutely, Sri Yukteswar went on, \"This is not an apparition, but my flesh and blood form.

I felt the materialistic, twentieth-century world slipping from me; was I back in the ancient days when Jesus appeared before Peter on the sea? \\nAs Sri Yukteswar, a modern Yogi-Christ, reached the spot where Dijen and I were speechlessly rooted, Master smiled at my friend and remarked: \\n\"I sent you a message too, but you were unable to grasp it.\" \\nDijen was silent, but glared at me suspiciously.

Though he smiled at my enthusiasm, his words were noncommittal: \"I would like to go; we shall see.\" He made no comment when I asked his little hermitage disciple, Kanai, to accompany us.

Finally I knocked at the front door. \\n\"Behari left by the back stairs about thirty minutes ago,\" a man informed me.

It was a sunny Thursday, I remember, in July, 1914, a few weeks after my graduation from college. On the inner balcony of his Serampore hermitage, Master dipped a new piece of white silk into a dye of ocher, the traditional color of the Swami Order. After the cloth had dried, my guru draped it around me as a renunciate\\'s robe. \\n\"Someday you will go to the West, where silk is preferred,\" he said. \"As a symbol, I have chosen for you this silk material instead of the customary cotton.\" \\nIn India, where monks embrace the ideal of poverty, a silk-clad swami is an unusual sight. Many yogis, however, wear garments of silk, which preserves certain subtle bodily currents better than cotton. \\n\"I am averse to ceremonies,\" Sri Yukteswar remarked. \"I will make you a swami in the bidwat'), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage174'}, page_content='(non-ceremonious) manner.\" \\nThe bibidisa or elaborate initiation into swamiship includes a fire ceremony, during which \\nsymbolical funeral rites are performed. The physical body of the disciple is represented as dead, cremated in the flame of wisdom. The newly-made swami is then given a chant, such as: \"This \\natma is Brahma\" \\n24-2  or \"Thou art That\" or \"I am He.\" Sri Yukteswar, however, with his love of \\nsimplicity, dispensed with all formal rites and merely asked me to select a new name. \\n\"I will give you the privilege of choosing it yourself,\" he said, smiling. \\n\"Yogananda,\" I replied, after a moment\\'s thought. The name literally means \"Bliss (ananda ) \\nthrough divine union (yoga ).\" \\n\"Be it so. Forsaking your family name of Mukunda Lal Ghosh, henceforth you shall be called \\nYogananda of the Giri branch of the Swami Order.\" \\nAs I knelt before Sri Yukteswar, and for the first time heard him pronounce my new name, my heart overflowed with gratitude. How lovingly and tirelessly had he labored, that the boy Mukunda be someday transformed into the monk Yogananda! I joyfully sang a few verses from the long Sanskrit chant of Lord Shankara: \\n  \"Mind, nor intellect, nor ego, feeling;  Sky nor earth nor metals am I.  I am He, I am He, Blessed Spirit, I am He!

Shortly after I had entered the Swami Order, I paid a visit to my birthplace, Gorakhpur, as a guest of my elder brother Ananta. A sudden illness confined him to his bed; I nursed him lovingly. \\nThe solemn inward pronouncement filled me with grief. I felt that I could not bear to remain longer in Gorakhpur, only to see my brother removed before my helpless gaze. Amidst uncomprehending criticism from my relatives, I left India on the first available boat. It cruised along Burma and the China Sea to Japan. I disembarked at Kobe, where I spent only a few days. My heart was too heavy for sightseeing. \\nOn the return trip to India, the boat touched at Shanghai. There Dr. Misra, the ship\\'s physician, guided me to several curio shops, where I selected various presents for Sri Yukteswar and my family and friends. For Ananta I purchased a large carved bamboo piece. No sooner had the Chinese salesman handed me the bamboo souvenir than I dropped it on the floor, crying out, \"I have bought this for my dear dead brother!\" \\nA clear realization had swept over me that his soul was just being freed in the Infinite. The souvenir was sharply and symbolically cracked by its fall; amidst sobs, I wrote on the bamboo surface: \"For my beloved Ananta, now gone.\" \\nMy companion, the doctor, was observing these proceedings with a sardonic smile. \\n\"Save your tears,\" he remarked. \"Why shed them until you are sure he is dead?\"'), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage180'}, page_content='When our boat reached Calcutta, Dr. Misra again accompanied me.

The Sanskrit root of Kriya is kri, to do, to act and react; the same root is found in the word karma, the natural principle of cause and effect. Kriya Yoga is thus \"union (yoga) with the Infinite through a certain action or \\nrite.\" A yogi who faithfully follows its technique is gradually freed from karma or the universal chain of causation. \\nBecause of certain ancient yogic injunctions, I cannot give a full explanation of Kriya Yoga in the pages of a book intended for the general public. The actual technique must be learned from a \\nKriyaban or Kriya Yogi; here a broad reference must suffice. \\nKriya Yoga is a simple, psychophysiological method by which the human blood is decarbonized'), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage184'}, page_content='and recharged with oxygen. The atoms of this extra oxygen are transmuted into life current to \\nrejuvenate the brain and spinal centers. 26-1 By stopping the accumulation of venous blood, the \\nyogi is able to lessen or prevent the decay of tissues; the advanced yogi transmutes his cells into \\npure energy. Elijah, Jesus, Kabir and other prophets were past masters in the use of Kriya or a \\nsimilar technique, by which they caused their bodies to dematerialize at will. \\nKriya is an ancient science. Lahiri Mahasaya received it from his guru, Babaji, who rediscovered and clarified the technique after it had been lost in the Dark Ages. \\n\"The Kriya Yoga which I am giving to the world through you in this nineteenth century,\" Babaji told Lahiri Mahasaya, \"is a revival of the same science which Krishna gave, millenniums ago, to Arjuna, and which was later known to Patanjali, and to Christ, St. John, St. Paul, and other disciples.\" \\nKriya Yoga is referred to by Krishna, India\\'s greatest prophet, in a stanza of the Bhagavad Gita: \"Offering inhaling breath into the outgoing breath, and offering the outgoing breath into the inhaling breath, the yogi neutralizes both these breaths; he thus releases the life force from the \\nheart and brings it under his control.\" \\n26-2  The interpretation is: \"The yogi arrests decay in the \\nbody by an addition of life force, and arrests the mutations of growth in the body by apan \\n(eliminating current).

A person whose attention is wholly engrossed, as in following some closely knit intellectual argument, or in attempting some delicate or difficult physical feat, automatically breathes very slowly.

Thus he removes himself from studied observance of natural laws, which can only take him-by circuitous means as given by proper food, sunlight, and harmonious thoughts-to a million-year Goal.

I saw clearly the arid results of ordinary instruction, aimed only at the development of body and intellect. Moral and spiritual values, without whose appreciation no man can approach happiness, were yet lacking in the formal curriculum. I determined to found a school where young boys could develop to the full stature of manhood. My first step in that direction was made with seven children at Dihika, a small country site in Bengal. \\nA year later, in 1918, through the generosity of Sir Manindra Chandra Nundy, the Maharaja of Kasimbazar, I was able to transfer my fast- growing group to Ranchi. This town in Bihar, about two hundred miles from Calcutta, is blessed with one of the most healthful climates in India. The Kasimbazar Palace at Ranchi was transformed into the headquarters for the new school, which I \\ncalled Brahmacharya Vidyalaya \\n27-1 in accordance with the educational ideals of the rishis. \\nTheir forest ashrams had been the ancient seats of learning, secular and divine, for the youth of'), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage191'}, page_content='India. \\nAt Ranchi I organized an educational program for both grammar and high school grades. It \\nincluded agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic subjects. The students were also taught yoga concentration and meditation, and a unique system of physical development, \"Yogoda,\" whose principles I had discovered in 1916. \\nRealizing that man\\'s body is like an electric battery, I reasoned that it could be recharged with energy through the direct agency of the human will. As no action, slight or large, is possible \\nwithout willing, man can avail himself of his prime mover, will, to renew his bodily tissues \\nwithout burdensome apparatus or mechanical exercises. I therefore taught the Ranchi students my simple \"Yogoda\" techniques by which the life force, centred in man\\'s medulla oblongata, can be consciously and instantly recharged from the unlimited supply of cosmic energy. \\nThe boys responded wonderfully to this training, developing extraordinary ability to shift the life energy from one part of the body to another part, and to sit in perfect poise in difficult body \\npostures. \\n27-2 They performed feats of strength and endurance which many powerful adults could \\nnot equal.

One of the Shiva temples founded by the Lahiris went into the river along with the family home.

Just and open-minded, however, he did not ignore the beneficial current of modern ideas. \\nThe boy Lahiri took lessons in Hindi and Urdu in Benares study-groups. He attended a school conducted by Joy Narayan Ghosal, receiving instruction in Sanskrit, Bengali, French, and \\nEnglish. Applying himself to a close study of the Vedas, the young yogi listened eagerly to \\nscriptural discussions by learned Brahmins, including a Marhatta pundit named Nag-Bhatta. \\nShyama Charan was a kind, gentle, and courageous youth, beloved by all his companions. With a well-proportioned, bright, and powerful body, he excelled in swimming and in many skillful activities. \\nIn 1846 Shyama Charan Lahiri was married to Srimati Kashi Moni, daughter of Sri Debnarayan Sanyal. A model Indian housewife, Kashi Moni cheerfully carried on her home duties and the traditional householder's obligation to serve guests and the poor. Two saintly sons, Tincouri and Ducouri, blessed the union. \\nAt the age of 23, in 1851, Lahiri Mahasaya took the post of accountant in the Military Engineering Department of the English government. He received many promotions during the time of his service.

The work of these two fully-illumined masters-one with the body, and one without it-is to inspire the nations to forsake suicidal wars, race hatreds, religious sectarianism, and the boomerang-evils of materialism. Babaji is well aware of the trend of modern times, especially of the influence and complexities of Western civilization, and realizes the necessity of spreading the self-liberations of yoga equally in the West and in the East. \\nThat there is no historical reference to Babaji need not surprise us. The great guru has never openly appeared in any century; the misinterpreting glare of publicity has no place in his millennial plans. Like the Creator, the sole but silent Power, Babaji works in a humble obscurity. \\nGreat prophets like Christ and Krishna come to earth for a specific and spectacular purpose; they depart as soon as it is accomplished. Other avatars, like Babaji, undertake work which is concerned more with the slow evolutionary progress of man during the centuries than with any one outstanding event of history.

Does it matter that we know not the patronymic of an earth-released master? \\n\"Whenever anyone utters with reverence the name of Babaji,\" Lahiri Mahasaya said, \"that devotee attracts an instant spiritual blessing.\" \\nThe deathless guru bears no marks of age on his body; he appears to be no more than a youth of twenty-five.

Then He quickened it; energy atoms came into being. He coordinated the atoms into this solid sphere. All its molecules are held together by the will of God. When He withdraws His will, the earth again will disintegrate into energy. Energy will dissolve into consciousness; the earth-idea will disappear from objectivity. \\n\"\\'The substance of a dream is held in materialization by the subconscious thought of the dreamer. When that cohesive thought is withdrawn in wakefulness, the dream and its elements dissolve. A man closes his eyes and erects a dream-creation which, on awakening, he effortlessly dematerializes.

Similarly, when he awakens in cosmic consciousness, he will effortlessly dematerialize the illusions of the cosmic dream. \\n\"\\'Being one with the infinite all-accomplishing Will, Babaji can summon the elemental atoms to combine and manifest themselves in any form.

India has developed certain valuable religious attitudes of mind and ethical notions which are unique, at least in the wideness of their application to life. One of these has been a tolerance in questions of intellectual belief-doctrine-that is amazing to the West, where for many centuries heresy-hunting was common, and bloody wars between nations over sectarian rivalries were frequent.\"-Extracts from an article by Professor W.

Many are hermits \\nwho never leave their secluded haunts except to attend the melas and bestow their blessings on \\nworldly men and women. \\n\"I was not a swami at the time I met Babaji,\" Sri Yukteswar went on. \"But I had already received \\nKriya initiation from Lahiri Mahasaya. He encouraged me to attend the mela which was convening in January, 1894 at Allahabad. It was my first experience of a kumbha; I felt slightly \\ndazed by the clamor and surge of the crowd. In my searching gazes around I saw no illumined face of a master. Passing a bridge on the bank of the Ganges, I noticed an acquaintance standing near-by, his begging bowl extended. \\n\"\\'Oh, this fair is nothing but a chaos of noise and beggars,\\' I thought in disillusionment. \\'I wonder if Western scientists, patiently enlarging the realms of knowledge for the practical good of mankind, are not more pleasing to God than these idlers who profess religion but concentrate on alms.\\' \\n\"My smouldering reflections on social reform were interrupted by the voice of a tall sannyasi who halted before me. \\n\"\\'Sir,\\' he said, \\'a saint is calling you.\\' \\n\"\\'Who is he?\\' \\n\"\\'Come and see for yourself.\\' \\n\"Hesitantly following this laconic advice, I soon found myself near a tree whose branches were'), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage254'}, page_content='sheltering a guru with an attractive group of disciples.

A sudden left turn, and there before us towered the simple but inspiring two-story ashram, its Spanish-style balcony jutting from the upper floor. The pervasive impression was that of peaceful solitude. \\n\"In grave humility I walked behind Yoganandaji into the courtyard within the hermitage walls. Hearts beating fast, we proceeded up some old cement steps, trod, no doubt, by myriads of truth-seekers. The tension grew keener and keener as on we strode. Before us, near the head of the stairs, quietly appeared the Great One, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, standing in the noble pose of a sage. \\n\"My heart heaved and swelled as I felt myself blessed by the privilege of being in his sublime presence. Tears blurred my eager sight when Yoganandaji dropped to his knees, and with bowed head offered his soul\\'s gratitude and greeting, touching with his hand his guru\\'s feet and then, in humble obeisance, his own head. He rose then and was embraced on both sides of the bosom by Sri Yukteswarji. \\n\"No words passed at the beginning, but the most intense feeling was expressed in the mute phrases of the soul. How their eyes sparkled and were fired with the warmth of renewed soul-union! A tender vibration surged through the quiet patio, and even the sun eluded the clouds to add a sudden blaze of glory. \\n\"On bended knee before the master I gave my own unexpressed love and thanks, touching his feet, calloused by time and service, and receiving his blessing. I stood then and faced two beautiful deep eyes smouldering with introspection, yet radiant with joy. We entered his sitting room, whose whole side opened to the outer balcony first seen from the street.

But I perceived the saintliness of the Great One through his heart-warming smile and twinkling eyes. One quality easily discernible in his merry, serious conversation is a decided positiveness in statement-the mark of a wise man, who knows he knows, because he knows God. His great wisdom, strength of purpose, and determination are \\napparent in every way. \\n\"Studying him reverently from time to time, I noted that he is of large, athletic stature, hardened \\nby the trials and sacrifices of renunciation.

His powerful dark eyes are haloed by an ethereal blue ring. His hair, parted in the middle, begins as silver and changes to streaks of silvery-gold and silvery-black, ending in ringlets at his shoulders. His beard and moustache are scant or thinned out, yet seem to enhance his features and, like his character, are deep and light at the same time. \\n\"He has a jovial and rollicking laugh which comes from deep in his chest, causing him to shake and quiver throughout his body-very cheerful and sincere. His face and stature are striking in their power, as are his muscular fingers. He moves with a dignified tread and erect posture. \\n\"He was clad simply in the common dhoti and shirt, both once dyed a strong ocher color, but now a faded orange. \\n\"Glancing about, I observed that this rather dilapidated room suggested the owner\\'s non-attachment to material comforts. The weather-stained white walls of the long chamber were streaked with fading blue plaster. At one end of the room hung a picture of Lahiri Mahasaya, garlanded in simple devotion. There was also an old picture showing Yoganandaji as he had first arrived in Boston, standing with the other delegates to the Congress of Religions. \\n\"I noted a quaint concurrence of modernity and antiquation. A huge, cut-glass, candle-light chandelier was covered with cobwebs through disuse, and on the wall was a bright, up-to-date calendar. The whole room emanated a fragrance of peace and calmness. Beyond the balcony I could see coconut trees towering over the hermitage in silent protection. \\n\"It is interesting to observe that the master has merely to clap his hands together and, before finishing, he is served or attended by some small disciple.

My lifelong dream of a permanently endowed yoga educational center stood fulfilled. That vision had guided me in the humble beginnings in 1917 with a group of seven boys. \\nIn the decade since 1935, Ranchi has enlarged its scope far beyond the boys' school.

The boys themselves regulate most of their activities through autonomous \\ncommittees. Very early in my career as an educator I discovered that boys who impishly delight in outwitting a teacher will cheerfully accept disciplinary rules that are set by their fellow students. Never a model pupil myself, I had a ready sympathy for all boyish pranks and problems. \\nSports and games are encouraged; the fields resound with hockey and football practice. Ranchi students often win the cup at competitive events. The outdoor gymnasium is known far and wide. \\nMuscle recharging through will power is the Yogoda feature: mental direction of life energy to any part of the body. The boys are also taught asanas (postures), sword and lathi (stick) play, and jujitsu. The Yogoda Health Exhibitions at the Ranchi Vidyalaya have been attended by \\nthousands. \\nInstruction in primary subjects is given in Hindi to the Kols, Santals, and Mundas, aboriginal tribes of the province. Classes for girls only have been organized in near-by villages. \\nThe unique feature at Ranchi is the initiation into Kriya Yoga. The boys daily practice their \\nspiritual exercises, engage in Gita chanting, and are taught by precept and example the virtues of \\nsimplicity, self-sacrifice, honor, and truth.

Where there is great license or so-called liberty, particularly in intermarriage between extremes in the natural castes, the race dwindles away and becomes extinct. The Purana Samhita compares the offspring of such unions to barren hybrids, like the mule which is incapable of propagation of its own species. Artificial species are eventually exterminated. History offers abundant proof of numerous great races which no longer have any living representatives. The caste system of India is credited by her most profound thinkers with being the check or preventive against license which has preserved the purity of the race and brought it safely through millenniums of vicissitudes, while other races have vanished in oblivion.\" \\n41-10: His full title was Sri Sadasivendra Saraswati Swami.

The site faces Olive Hill and the distant Los Angeles Planetarium. The church, finished in blue, white, and gold, is reflected amidst the water hyacinths in a large pool. The gardens are gay with flowers, a few startled stone deer, a stained- glass \\npergola, and a quaint wishing well. Thrown in with the pennies and the kaleidoscopic wishes of \\nman has been many a pure aspiration for the sole treasure of Spirit! A universal benignity flows from small niches with statues of Lahiri Mahasaya and Sri Yukteswar, and of Krishna, Buddha, Confucius, St. Francis, and a beautiful mother-of- pearl reproduction of Christ at the Last Supper. \\nAnother Self-Realization Church of All Religions was founded in 1943 at San Diego.

Where is there pure loving love?  Where is there truly loving Thee?  There my heart longs to be.\\nMy companion in the chapel, Dr. Lloyd Kennell, the San Diego center leader, was smiling a little at the words of the song. \\n\"Tell me truly, Paramhansaji, has it been worth it?\" He gazed at me with an earnest sincerity. I understood his laconic question: \"Have you been happy in America? What about the disillusionments, the heartaches, the center leaders who could not lead, the students who could not be taught?\" \\n\"Blessed is the man whom the Lord doth test, Doctor! He has remembered now and then to put a burden on me!\" I thought, then, of all the faithful ones, of the love and devotion and understanding that lay in the heart of America. With slow emphasis I went on, \"But my answer is: Yes, a thousand times yes! It has been worth-while; it has been a constant inspiration, more than ever I dreamed, to see West and East brought closer in the only lasting bond, the spiritual!\" \\nSilently I added a prayer: \"May Babaji and Sri Yukteswarji feel that I have done my part, not disappointing the high hope in which they sent me forth.\" \\nI turned again to the organ; this time my song was tinged with a martial valor: \\n  The grinding wheel of Time doth mar  Full many a life of moon and star  And many a brightly smiling morn-  But still my soul is marching on!\\n  Darkness, death, and failures vied;\\n  To block my path they fiercely tried;\\n  My fight with jealous Nature\\'s strong-  But still my soul is marching on!'), Document(metadata={'title': 'autobiography-of-a-yogi.pdfpage360'}, page_content='New Year\\'s week of 1945 found me at work in my Encinitas study, revising the manuscript of this \\nbook. \\n\"Paramhansaji, please come outdoors.\" Dr. Lewis, on a visit from Boston, smiled at me pleadingly from outside my window. Soon we were strolling in the sunshine. My companion pointed to new towers in process of construction along the edge of the Fellowship property adjoining the coast highway. \\n\"Sir, I see many improvements here since my last visit.\" Dr. Lewis comes twice annually from Boston to Encinitas. \\n\"Yes, Doctor, a project I have long considered is beginning to take definite form. In these beautiful surroundings I have started a miniature world colony. Brotherhood is an ideal better understood by example than precept! A small harmonious group here may inspire other ideal communities over the earth.\" \\n\"A splendid idea, sir! The colony will surely be a success if everyone sincerely does his part!\" \\n\"\\'World\\' is a large term, but man must enlarge his allegiance, considering himself in the light of a world citizen,\" I continued. \"A person who truly feels: \\'The world is my homeland; it is my America, my India, my Philippines, my England, my Africa,\\' will never lack scope for a useful and happy life. His natural local pride will know limitless expansion; he will be in touch with creative universal currents.\" \\nDr. Lewis and I halted above the lotus pool near the hermitage. Below us lay the illimitable Pacific. \\n\"These same waters break equally on the coasts of West and East, in California and China.\" My companion threw a little stone into the first of the oceanic seventy million square miles. \"Encinitas is a symbolic spot for a world colony.\" \\n\"That is true, Doctor. We shall arrange here for many conferences and Congresses of Religion, inviting delegates from all lands. Flags of the nations will hang in our halls. Diminutive temples will be built over the grounds, dedicated to the world\\'s principal religions. \\n\"As soon as possible,\" I went on, \"I plan to open a Yoga Institute here.

Utopia must spring in the private bosom before it can flower in civic virtue. Man is a soul, not an institution; his inner reforms alone can lend permanence to outer ones. By stress on spiritual values, self- realization, a colony exemplifying world brotherhood is empowered to send inspiring vibrations far beyond its locale. \\nAugust 15, 1945, close of Global War II!

      " Paramahansa Yogananda was a spiritual teacher and author who wrote the book \"Autobiography of a Yogi\". He was born in India in 1893 and died in 1952. He was a swami, which means he was a formally recognized monk, and he was also a yogi, which means he practiced the science of yoga. According to the passage, Yogananda was known as both a swami and a yogi, and he was successful in reaching his high goal. He believed that yoga is applicable to people of every clime and time, and he taught it to thousands of Americans through lectures and books."
